# Module 1: Introduction to HTML

In this module is provided an overview of HTML, its role in web development, its structure and elements, and an introduction to
some common HTML terminology. Let's get started!

### 1.1: What is HTML?
HTML, short for HyperText Markup Language, is the standard markup language used for creating and structuring web pages. 
It provides a set of tags or elements that define the structure, content, and presentation of web documents. HTML allows 
you to format text, add images, create links, embed multimedia, and more.

### 1.2: HTML's Role in Web Development
HTML forms the foundation of web development. It provides the structure and semantic meaning to web pages, enabling browsers
and search engines to understand and display content correctly. HTML is complemented by CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) for 
styling and JavaScript for adding interactivity, creating dynamic web experiences.

### 1.3: HTML Structure and Elements
HTML documents are structured using a hierarchical structure. The basic structure of an HTML document consists of the following elements:

- `<!DOCTYPE>` declaration: This declares the HTML version being used, helping browsers to interpret the document correctly.

- `<html>` element: This is the root element of an HTML document and serves as the container for all other elements.

- `<head>` element: This section contains meta-information about the document, such as the document title, character encoding, CSS stylesheets, and more.

- `<body>` element: This is where the visible content of the web page resides, including headings, paragraphs, images, links, and other elements.

### 1.4: Common HTML Terminology
To work effectively with HTML, it's essential to understand some common HTML terminology:

- <b>Tags</b>: HTML elements are represented by tags, which are enclosed within angle brackets (< >). Tags define the purpose and behavior of the elements.

- <b>Opening and closing tags</b>: Most HTML elements have an opening tag (<tag>) and a closing tag (</tag>). The content between the opening and closing tags is the element's content.

- <b>Attributes</b>: Attributes provide additional information about HTML elements. They are specified within the opening tag and consist of a name and a value. Attributes modify the behavior or appearance of elements.

- <b>Nesting</b>: HTML elements can be nested inside one another. This means that elements can be placed inside other elements, creating a hierarchical structure.

- <b>Comments</b>: HTML comments are used to add notes or descriptions within the HTML code. They are not displayed on the web page and serve as a way to document the code.

- <b>Semantics</b>: HTML has a set of semantic elements that provide meaning and structure to the content. Semantic elements, such as `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<article>`, `<section>`, `<aside>`, and `<footer>`, convey the purpose and role of the content within the document.

Understanding these terms will greatly assist you in effectively using HTML to create well-structured web pages.

### 1.5: Closing Thoughts
In Module 1, we introduced HTML and its significance in web development. We explored the structure and elements of HTML and familiarize ourselves with common HTML terminology. Having a solid understanding of HTML's fundamentals is crucial as we dive deeper into creating dynamic and visually appealing web pages.

In the next module, we will delve into the basic HTML document structure and learn how to create a well-formed HTML document. Get ready to embark on an exciting journey into the world of HTML!
