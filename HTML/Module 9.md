# Module 9: Semantic HTML

In this module, we will explore semantic HTML. Semantic HTML refers to the use of HTML elements that carry meaning and convey the structure and purpose of the content. It improves accessibility, SEO, and the overall understanding of the web page. We'll cover the benefits of semantic HTML, common semantic elements in HTML5, and how to use them for accessibility and SEO. Let's get started!

### 9.1: Semantic HTML and its Benefits
Semantic HTML focuses on using elements that accurately describe the content they wrap. By using semantic elements, you provide meaningful information to both humans and machines, such as search engines and screen readers. The benefits of semantic HTML include:

- Accessibility: Semantic HTML helps screen readers and assistive technologies understand the content better, making it more accessible to individuals with disabilities.
- Search Engine Optimization (SEO): Search engines rely on semantic HTML to understand the structure and context of web pages. Using semantic elements can positively impact your website's search engine rankings.
- Code Maintainability: Semantic HTML improves code readability and maintainability. It helps you and other developers better understand the structure and purpose of different sections of a webpage.

### 9.2 Semantic Elements in HTML5
HTML5 introduced several semantic elements that can be used to structure a webpage. Let's explore some of the common semantic elements:

- `<header>`: Represents the introductory content or a container for a group of navigational links or site-related information.
- `<nav>`: Represents a section of the page that contains navigation links.
- `<article>`: Represents an independent, self-contained piece of content, such as a blog post or a news article.
- `<section>`: Represents a standalone section that groups related content.
- `<aside>`: Represents content that is tangentially related to the main content, such as sidebars or pull quotes.
- `<footer>`: Represents the footer of a section or the entire page, typically containing copyright information, contact details, or related links.

Here's an example of how these elements can be used:

```html
<header>
  <h1>My Website</h1>
  <nav>
    <!-- Navigation links go here -->
  </nav>
</header>

<section>
  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <article>
    <!-- Article content goes here -->
  </article>
</section>

<aside>
  <!-- Sidebar content goes here -->
</aside>

<footer>
  <!-- Footer content goes here -->
</footer>
```

By using these semantic elements, you provide clear structure and meaning to your HTML code.

### 9.3: Using Semantic Elements for Accessibility and SEO
Semantic HTML plays a vital role in enhancing accessibility and SEO. When using semantic elements, keep the following best practices in mind:

- Descriptive Headings: Use appropriate heading elements (`<h1>` to `<h6>`) to structure your content. These headings help screen readers and search engines understand the hierarchy of your page.
- Alt Text for Images: Always provide descriptive alternative text (`alt` attribute) for images. This ensures that screen readers can convey the meaning of images to visually impaired users, and search engines can understand the content of the images.
- Proper Link Text: Use meaningful link text that accurately describes the linked content. Avoid generic phrases like "click here" and instead use descriptive text that indicates the purpose of the link.

Remember, using semantic elements is not only beneficial for accessibility and SEO but also improves the overall user experience.

That concludes Module 9 on semantic HTML. We've learned about the benefits of semantic HTML, common semantic elements in HTML5, and how to use them for accessibility and SEO. Practice incorporating semantic elements into your web pages and enjoy the benefits they bring.
