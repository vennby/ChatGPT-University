# Module 3: Defining the Task and Specifying Inputs
In this module, we will focus on defining the task and specifying inputs in prompt engineering. We will explore how to identify task requirements and objectives, select appropriate input formats and context, and handle multiple inputs and conditioning.

### 3.1: Identifying the Task Requirements and Objectives
Before crafting prompts, it is crucial to clearly define the task requirements and objectives. By understanding the task at hand, we can tailor our prompts to elicit the desired responses from language models.

#### Task Definition
   - Clearly define the specific task or objective you want to accomplish using the language model.
   - Identify the purpose, scope, and expected outcomes of the task.

#### Task Analysis
   - Analyze the requirements, constraints, and potential challenges associated with the task.
   - Consider the context in which the language model will be used and the target audience or users.

#### Desired Outputs
   - Determine the desired characteristics, quality, or properties of the outputs generated by the language model.
   - Specify any specific formatting, style, or content requirements for the outputs.

### 3.2: Selecting Appropriate Input Formats and Context
The selection of input formats and context plays a vital role in prompt engineering. Different tasks may require specific input structures and context to guide the language model effectively.

#### Input Format
   - Choose an input format that aligns with the task requirements and the desired behavior of the language model.
   - Single sentence, prompt-completion, or contextual input formats can be used based on the task at hand.

#### Contextual Information
   - Determine the level of contextual information required to provide necessary background for the language model.
   - Consider whether the task requires a single context or multiple contexts for a comprehensive understanding.

#### Preprocessing
   - Preprocess the input text to ensure it is compatible with the selected input format and aligns with the task objectives.
   - Tokenization, normalization, and any other relevant preprocessing steps can be applied as needed.

### 3.3: Handling Multiple Inputs and Conditioning
In some cases, prompt engineering involves handling multiple inputs or conditioning the language model's responses based on specific conditions. Let's explore the considerations and techniques for effectively managing such scenarios:

#### Multiple Inputs
   - Some tasks may require multiple inputs, such as question-answering or dialogue systems.
   - Define the structure and organization of multiple inputs, ensuring clarity and proper alignment with the task objectives.

#### Conditioning
   - Conditioning refers to providing additional information or constraints to guide the language model's responses.
   - Define the conditioning factors, such as sentiment, topic, or style, and incorporate them into the prompt to achieve desired behavior.

#### Customization and Fine-tuning
   - Fine-tuning language models on specific datasets or domains can enhance their performance and adapt them to specific task requirements.
   - Customizing prompts and training on task-specific data can lead to improved results.
