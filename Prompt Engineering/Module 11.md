# Module 11: Case Studies and Practical Examples
Here are a few case studies and practical examples that can help illustrate the application of prompt engineering techniques:

### Case Study 1: Sentiment Analysis
**Scenario**: You are working on a project that involves sentiment analysis of customer reviews for a product. The goal is to classify the sentiment of each review as positive, negative, or neutral.

**Prompt Engineering Problems**:
- Craft a prompt that clearly instructs the model to analyze the sentiment of the given review.
- Experiment with different variations of prompts by incorporating example review snippets to guide the model's understanding.
- Fine-tune a language model with a labeled sentiment analysis dataset using the designed prompts.

**Practical Exercise**:
- Collect a dataset of customer reviews with sentiment labels (positive, negative, neutral).
- Design prompts that effectively guide the language model to perform sentiment analysis.
- Fine-tune a language model using the collected dataset and evaluate its performance on unseen customer reviews.

### Case Study 2: Text Summarization
**Scenario**: You are working on a text summarization project where you need to develop a system that can generate concise summaries of news articles.

**Prompt Engineering Problems**:
- Design prompts that instruct the model to generate a summary that captures the key information of the input article.
- Experiment with different approaches, such as using control codes or conditioning techniques, to guide the model's summarization output.
- Fine-tune a language model on a dataset of news articles with corresponding summaries.

**Practical Exercise**:
- Gather a dataset of news articles along with their human-generated summaries.
- Create prompts that direct the language model to generate informative and concise summaries.
- Fine-tune a language model using the collected dataset and evaluate its performance by comparing its generated summaries with human-written summaries.

These case studies and practical exercises can serve as starting points for your exploration of prompt engineering. It's important to adapt and tailor them to your specific project or domain. Remember to consider the unique requirements and constraints of each task, evaluate the performance of your prompt engineering techniques, and iterate as necessary.
